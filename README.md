As a upcoming graduate with a strong passion for technology and a commitment to solving intricate challenges, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and analytical skills to the table. My professional journey has been shaped by diverse experiences, each contributing to my well-rounded approach to problem-solving. At Geek Squad, I honed my technical and leadership abilities by supervising a dynamic team and providing exceptional customer support. As an online remote specialist, I connected to clients' devices remotely to troubleshoot and repair them, ensuring seamless and efficient resolutions for a wide range of technical issues. During my tenure at Citi, I developed a meticulous eye for detail and a methodical approach to problem-solving while investigating and resolving complex fraud cases. This role demanded thorough research and quick decision-making to protect clients and the organization from financial threats. I used Iovation, which is like Splunk for the fraud world and LexisNexis to aid me in my early days of intrusion detection. In my free time, I immerse myself in hands-on experimentation with my home lab setup, exploring new technologies and scenarios to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Additionally, I am crafting a comprehensive roadmap for aspiring cybersecurity professionals, aimed at guiding them toward success in this dynamic industry. Stay tuned‚Äîthis resource will be published here soon! I‚Äôm always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and exchange ideas. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out to discuss technology, cybersecurity, or any innovative ideas you‚Äôd like to share!

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
